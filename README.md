# Team3_Website
Team 3 Website featuring Bootstrap (and jQuery)!

This is our team's website, built from scratch, on the Bootstrap 3.0 framework. It will serve as both a canvas for our semester-long project and a demonstration of our knowledge of various languages, libraries, concepts, etc.

The Bootstrap 3.3.5 framework documentation and download can be found at: http://getbootstrap.com/
The jQuery 2.1.4 files can be found at: https://jquery.com/
